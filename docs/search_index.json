Calculate the five-number summary of these data. library(stat0002) # To give us a better understanding of the data imported: sort(days) ## [1] 31 199 491 881 895 967 989 1036 1260 1418 1427 1460 1460 1460 1460 ## [16] 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1460 1461 1461 1461 1503 1655 1886 2027 ## [31] 2039 2727 2810 2864 2921 2921 2921 2921 2921 2921 2922 2922 2922 2922 2922 ## [46] 4422 fivenum(days) ## [1] 31.0 1460.0 1460.5 2921.0 4422.0 Therefore, the five-number summary of the dataset is (31, 1460, 1460.5, 2921, 4422) days. 1.2 Question 2 Create a boxplot of these data. Combining the shape of this boxplot and the data summary we acquired above, the shape of the distribution of this dataset is slightly positively skewed. There are no outliers. All the data values are concluded in the boxplot. The boxplot visualizes the five-number summary as well as the location, shape, and spread of the distribution. 1.3 Question 3 Create histograms of these data with with different breaks. While the first histogram shows us a rough shape and distribution, the second histogram is more detailed with more breaks. We can easily identify the modes of distribution using histograms and acquire a basic shape of the distribution as well. 1.4 Question 4 Create a stem-and-leaf plot of the data. stem(days) ## ## The decimal point is 3 digit(s) to the right of the | ## ## 0 | 02 ## 0 | 599 ## 1 | 000344 ## 1 | 555555555555555579 ## 2 | 00 ## 2 | 78999999999999 ## 3 | ## 3 | ## 4 | 4 We could conclude from this plot that the shape of this dataset follows a bimodal distribution, where a lot of values in the data fall around 1500 and 2900. 1.5 Question 5 Create a dot plot of the data. The dot plot confirms our conclusion from the stem-and-leaf plot stated above. 1.6 Question 6 Find if there are any outliers in this dataset. IQR &lt;- IQR(days) UpperBound &lt;- 2921 + 1.5 * IQR LowerBound &lt;- 1460 - 1.5 * IQR UpperBound ## [1] 5091.125 LowerBound ## [1] -710.125 All the values from the data fall in the range \\(\\in [-710.125, 5091.125]\\). Therefore, there aren’t any outliers. Since 2922 days are approximately equivalent to 8 years, these data might represent the time it takes for people to get a Ph.D., the 8-year cycle of Venus, or the length of the presidency of the United States.

As a result, \\(y_{1/2} = ax_{1/2} + b\\).

The precondition is \\(n \\geq 3\\) because when the sample size is too small, it’s meaningless to investigate summary statistics. There’s nothing to investigate about a set of variables with only one or two data. A smaller sample size also leads to increasing percentage uncertainty while calculating the data. Finally, \\(n \\neq 1\\) also because that the process of calculating standard deviation requires we use \\((n-1)\\) as a denominator, and 0 can’t be a denominator.

For each die: the possible scores are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Each score is equally likely, so each score has probability \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). You may assume that the score on red die is independent of the score on the blue die. We define the following events: \\(A\\): sum of the scores on the dice is 7. \\(B\\): the score on the red die is different from the score on the blue die. \\(C\\): the sum of the scores on the dice is 11. \\(D\\): the score on the red die is 6. 3.1 Question 1 (a) Calculate \\(P(A), P(B), P(C)\\), and \\(P(D)\\). \\[P(A) = (\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) \\cdot 6 = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ P(B) = \\frac{5}{6} \\\\ P(C) = (\\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) \\cdot 2 = \\frac{1}{18} \\\\ P(D) = \\frac{1}{6}\\] (b) Calculate \\(P(A,B), P(A,C)\\), and \\(P(A,D)\\). \\[P(A,B) = P(A) = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\ P(A,C) = 0 \\\\ P(A,D) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\] (c) Calculate \\(P(A or B), P(A or C)\\), and \\(P(A or D)\\). \\[P(A \\ or \\ B) = P(B) = \\frac{5}{6} \\\\ P(A \\ or \\ C) = P(A) + P(C) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{2}{9} \\\\ P(A \\ or \\ D) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{11}{36}\\] (d) Calculate \\(P(B \\mid A), P(C \\mid A)\\), and \\(P(D \\mid A)\\). \\[P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,B)}{P(A)} = 1 \\\\ P(C \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,C)}{P(A)} = 0 \\\\ P(D \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A,D)}{P(A)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{36}}{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\] 3.2 Question 2 Which of the following pairs of events are independent and why? (a) A and B. \\(P(A,B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\neq P(A) \\cdot P(B)\\), \\(\\therefore A\\) is not independent of \\(B\\). Events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are not independent if \\(A\\) happens (the sum of the scores on 2 dice equal 7), \\(B\\) must happen since the score on the red die must be different from the score on the blue one. (b) A and C. \\(P(A,C) = 0\\), \\(\\therefore A\\) is not independent of \\(C\\). Events A and C are not independent, they are mutually exclusive since these 2 events cannot happen at the same time. (c) A and D. \\(P(A,D) = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1}{36}\\), \\(\\therefore A \\perp B\\).

Justify your answer. Method 1: We can check the association by conducting a Chi-Square Test of Independence. Null hypothesis \\(H_0\\): There is no association between the number of flu injections and catching the flu. If the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) is true, and all the \\(\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}\\) are large enough (\\(\\hat{\\mu}_{ij} \\geq 5\\) for all i, j), then \\(X \\mathrel{\\dot\\sim} \\chi_{2}^{2}\\). \\[\\begin{aligned} \\chi_{2}^{2} &amp;= \\Sigma_{i.j} \\frac{(n_{ij} - \\hat{\\mu}_{ij})^2}{\\hat{\\mu}_{ij}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{(24 - 14.4)^2}{14.40} + \\frac{(9 - 5.01)^2}{5.01} + \\frac{(13-26.59)^2}{26.59} + \\frac{(289 - 298.60)^2}{298.60} + \\frac{(100 - 103.99)^2}{103.99} + \\frac{(565 - 551.41)^2}{551.41} \\\\ &amp;= 17.32 \\end{aligned}\\] We can plot the Chi-Square Density function: By inspecting the plot, we find that \\(P(\\chi_{2}^{2} \\geq 17.32)\\) is extremely small. We can use R to confirm that \\(P(\\chi_{2}^{2} \\geq 17.32) = 0.000173 \\ll 0.005\\) (using pchisq(17.32, 2, lower.tail = F)). Therefore, since the p-value is within the given significance level, we reject the null hypothesis. On the other hand, we can conduct the Chi-Square Test using R directly: Pearson&#39;s Chi-squared test data: data X-squared = 17, df = 2, p-value = 0.0002 Since the p-value calculated by R is \\(0.000174 \\ll 0.005\\), which is small enough to reject the null hypothesis, we can prove that there is an association between the number of flu injections and catching flu. Method 2: We can test the association by estimating the conditional probabilities. Table 8.4: Estimated Conditional Probabilities of the Number of Doses of Vaccines Injected Given Catching the Flu or Not \\(i = 0\\) \\(i = 1\\) \\(i = 2\\) \\(\\hat{P}(V = i \\mid F = 1)\\) 0.52 0.2 0.28 \\(\\hat{P}(V = i \\mid F = 0)\\) 0.30 0.1 0.59 Table 8.4: Estimated Conditional Probabilities of Catching the Flu or Not Given Number of Doses of Vaccines Injected \\(i = 0\\) \\(i = 1\\) \\(i = 2\\) \\(\\hat{P}(F = 1 \\mid V = i)\\) 0.08 0.08 0.02 \\(\\hat{P}(F = 0 \\mid V = i)\\) 0.92 0.92 0.98 We can either compare the estimated conditional probabilities of the doses of vaccines injected given having flu or not presented in the table above (Table 4), or do it the other way around (Table 5). We can clearly see that a large proportion of people who caught flu did not inject the vaccine, while about \\(70\\%\\) of people who didn’t catch flu at least injected one dose of vaccine. On the other hand, we can conclude that the proportion of people who injected one dose of vaccine catching flu is the same as the proportion of people who didn’t inject vaccines at all catching flu. But the proportion of people catching flu among those who injected two doses of vaccines has decreased significantly (a quarter comparing to the former ones). Therefore, there is an obvious association between doses of vaccines injected and catching flu or not. Injecting both doses of vaccines may effectively reduce the risk of catching flu, while on the other hand, injecting merely one dose of vaccine may not necessarily be effective. 8.6 Improvement Suppose that each person in this survey made their own decision whether to have \\(0\\), \\(1\\), or \\(2\\) vaccine injections. Can you see a potential problem with this? What would be a better way to find out how effective is the vaccine at preventing flu? The data collected may be unreliable if anyone among the sampled population reported the wrong data. It would further leads to the inaccuracy of our test result of independence / association of these variables. A better way to conduct this research is that we randomly draw samples of the same size from people who haven’t injected the vaccine, people who have had 1 injection of the vaccine, and people who have had 2 injections of the vaccine based on their medical record. Then, conduct a survey among these three sampled groups of people and see if they have had flu or not. "],["exercise-9.html", "Week 9 Exercise 9 9.1 Question 1 9.2 Question 2 9.3 Question 3", " Week 9 Exercise 9 Data are collected on the number of tornados, and the number of people killed by those tornados, in the USA in each of the 71 years from 1916 to 1986 inclusive. In the plot below on the left the mean number (\\(Y\\)) of people killed per tornado is plotted against year (\\(x\\)). The plot on the right is of the same data but \\(Y\\) is plotted on a log scale. 9.1 Question 1 Consider a simple linear regression model, with \\(z = x - 1986\\) as the explanatory variable. We consider using \\(Y\\) or \\(log Y\\) as the response variable, where we use \\(log Y\\) to denote the natural logarithm of \\(Y\\). (a) Should we use \\(Y\\) or \\(log Y\\) as the response variable in this linear regression? Explain your answer. We should use \\(log Y\\) as the response variable in this linear regression, because we can tell that the plot on the right has stronger linearity and relatively more constant variance of errors comparing to the plot on the left. (b) Why have we chosen to use \\(z = x - 1986\\) as the explanatory variable, rather than \\(x\\)? Because the data we collected starts from 1916. And essentially there isn’t any data for “year x = 0”. We want to avoid extrapolation. If we use \\(z = x - 1986\\), we are not comparing the data relative to year 0 anymore, but to the year 1986, and therefore the data could be interpreted in a more sensible way. 9.2 Question 2 A linear regression model of \\(log Y\\) is fitted using least squares estimation. Give an equation and some text to define this model and its assumptions. \\[log Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta z_i + \\epsilon_i \\quad i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 70\\] Or, on the other hand, \\[log Y_i = \\alpha + \\beta (x_i - 1986) + \\epsilon_i = \\alpha -1986\\beta + \\beta x_i + \\epsilon_i\\] Assumptions: Linearity: the conditional mean of \\(Y\\) given \\(x\\) is a linear function of \\(x\\). Constant Error Variance: the variability of \\(Y\\) is the same for all values of \\(x\\). Uncorrelatedness of Errors: the errors have no linear association. \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\ i \\in 1, ..., n\\) 9.3 Question 3 The estimate of the intercept is \\(-3.25\\) and the estimate of the coefficient of \\(z\\) is \\(-0.062\\). The estimate of the error variance is \\(0.64\\). Give interpretations of these estimates. Your answer should relate to the context of this problem, that is, tornados and should be stated in terms of the mean of the distribution of \\(Y\\) not \\(log Y\\). Inferring \\(\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid Z = z)\\). We assume that the error distribution is normal. We are given that \\[log Y_i = -3.25 - 0.062z_i + \\epsilon_i \\qquad i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 70\\] \\[ \\begin{aligned} log Y_i &amp;= -3.25 - 0.062(x_i -1986) + \\epsilon_i \\\\ &amp;= 119.88 - 0.062x_i + \\epsilon_i \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(\\epsilon \\in N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). Therefore, \\[Y = e^{-3.25-0.062z + \\epsilon} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad Y = e^{119.880-0.062x + \\epsilon}\\] It can be shown that \\(\\mathbb{E}(e^{\\epsilon}) = e^{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}}\\). Taking the expectation gives \\[\\therefore \\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid X = x) = e^{119.88 - 0.062x + \\sigma^2/2}\\] Inferring \\(\\text{median}(Y \\mid Z = z)\\). We assume that the error distribution is symmetric about 0, which implies that \\[\\mathbb{E}(log Y \\mid Z = z) = \\text{median}(log Y \\mid Z = z)\\] Therefore, \\[\\text{median}(Y \\mid Z = z) = exp{\\text{median}(log Y \\mid Z = z)} = e^{-3.25-0.062z}\\] \\[\\therefore \\text{median}(Y \\mid X = x) = e^{119.88 - 0.062x}\\] Therefore, combining the conditions we inferred, we can tell that \\[\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid X = x) = e^{\\sigma^2 / 2} \\ \\text{median}(Y \\mid X = x)\\] Since the error variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) is small, \\[\\mathbb{E}(Y \\mid X = x) \\approx \\text{median}(Y \\mid X = x)\\] Interpretation: In the year 1986 (when \\(x = 1986\\) or \\(z = 0\\)), \\(\\hat{median}(Y \\mid X = 1986) \\approx 0.04\\). Therefore, it implies that it is expected the mean, as well as the median, of the number of people died of tornado in the year 1986 is about 0.04 people. The coefficient \\(\\beta\\) represents that the number of people killed by tornado will drop by approximately 0.062 people per year. "]]
