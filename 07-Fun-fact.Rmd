# Fun Fact

**A fun fact introduced by Dr. Soo during the departmental social event:** 

Given that $U_1, U_2, U_3...$ are independent and identically distributed where $U_i \sim \text{unif}[0,1]$. \
Let $T = \textbf{min}\{n \leq 1: U_1 + U_2 + ... + U_n > 1\}$, where $n = 2, 3, 4..., etc$. \
The expected value of $T$ approximately equals to $e$, i.e., $\mathbb{E}(T) \approx e$.

We can prove this statement by running an R simulation:

```{r}
T <- function() {
  n = 0
  t = 0
  while (t < 1) {
    t <- t + runif(1)
    n <- n + 1
  }
  n
}
Expected_Value = mean(replicate(100000, T()))
```

```{r echo = F, comment = ''}
cat("E(T) =", Expected_Value)
```
